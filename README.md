# GITHUB Scraping

 - The data was scraped using the github API and python requests. Post caching, the requst results were converted to json and then after some cleaning, saved to a csv file.
 - The most interesting facts about the data was that there were comparatively very few users who worked at big tech giants.
 - Based on the analysis, I would like to suggest developers to provide concise and accurate information in their bio instead of long streached out descriptions.
